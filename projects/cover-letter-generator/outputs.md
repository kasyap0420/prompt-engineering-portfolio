### Cover Letter
Dear Hiring Manager,

I am applying for the Java Backend Intern role. I am a CSE student with hands-on practice in Java and Spring Boot, and I enjoy building clean REST APIs.

In my project â€œTracking-Number API,â€ I built backend endpoints using Spring Boot and connected them with a MySQL database. I used GitHub for version control and focused on writing clear and structured code. This helped me understand how backend systems handle requests, store data, and return responses.

I am comfortable with Java basics, REST API design, SQL queries, and using Git in a team workflow. I also learn fast and communicate clearly when I need help or when I complete a task.

Thank you for your time and consideration.

Sincerely,  
Kasyap Yanamandra
